Twitter Like Feed - Client Server Architecture

Node.js + Express Web application that uses a locally hosted MongoDB instance to store user posts and list them as a twitter-like feed  
Bad words are filtered out from posts using the npm bad-words package 

What's next?

1. Remove entering user name for posting by adding User Authentication
2. Allow users to reply to specific tweets (create threads)
3. When user posts on Client side, do a sentiment analysis of the post and adjust color of the post in the feed
